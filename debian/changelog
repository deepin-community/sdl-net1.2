sdl-net1.2 (1.2.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer
    - Make package as part of SDL team
    - Add myself to uploaders, and setting DM-Upload-Allowed: yes
  * Incorporated changes from Roman Vasiyarov <rvasiyarov@gmail.com>:
    - Added pkg-config files (Closes: #631085)
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.2 (no changes needed)
  * Changed debhelper compat to level 8 (level 4 before):
    - Updated dependency on debhelper to (>= 8.0.0)
    - Simplify a lot debian/rules file by leveraging debhelper capabilities,
      only acting when deviating from auto behaviour
  * Added 'source/format', with '3.0 (quilt)'
    - Removed dependency on dpatch
    - Convert patches, documenting and refreshing them
  * Convert ${pkg}.dirs and ${pkg}.files into ${pkg}.install
  * Updating 'watch' file to version=3
  * Added Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser in 'control' file
  * Modifications to dependencies and build options:
    - Depending on newer dpkg-dev
    - Depending on SDL >= 1.2.14 (instead of misc old versions)
    - Removed Conflict dependencies on libsdl-net1.1. It's very old and not
      present in any of the last Debian releases, long unsupported.
  * debian/copyright: updated and converted to DEP-5
  * Stop shipping .la files (Closes: #633328).  The command given in the bug
    report to remove dependency_libs is not working, and I don't think that any
    Debian package use .la anyway -- 0 rdepends for the -dev package.
